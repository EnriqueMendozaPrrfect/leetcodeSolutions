# 🧩 LeetCode Solutions

A repository dedicated to solving, documenting, and analyzing [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the reasoning, the strategy used, and a complexity analysis to facilitate learning and review.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
leetcodeSolutions/
└── src/
    └── <problemName>.ts   ← Each file contains the problem statement, explanation, and solution
```

Each solution file follows this format:

1. **Problem statement** — original description with examples and constraints.
2. **Strategy explanation** — intuitive analysis of the approach used.
3. **Clean solution** — concise and optimized implementation.
4. **Commented solution** — same implementation with line-by-line comments.
